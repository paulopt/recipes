        <li>soft white rolls</li>
        <li>coleslaw</li>
    
    </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        
        <li>Mix together 2 tsp each smoked paprika, ground cumin, pepper, and brown sugar, plus 1 tsp salt. Rub over the 2.5kg boneless shoulder of pork.</li>
              
        <li>Put the pork in a big casserole dish, skin-side up, and pour in 2 medium mugfuls of cider.</li>
                
        <li>Cover with a lid and cook in the oven at 150C/130C fan/gas 2 for anywhere between 4 and 8 hrs until falling apart. Check every few hours in case it gets dry – if it does, add another mugful of cider.</li>
                
        <li>Take it out of the oven and put the meat in a big dish, leaving the liquid in the casserole.</li>
        <li>Cut the skin off, then shred the meat using two forks. Ditch any fatty bits, and skim any excess fat off the surface of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a mugful of a good smoky BBQ sauce to the casserole, mix it in, then ladle some into a bowl for dipping.</li>
        <li>Put the pulled pork back in the casserole with the juices so it stays moist. Season to taste. Can be made one day ahead.</li>
        <li>Serve in soft white rolls with coleslaw and the bowl of juices on the side for ‘French dipping’ the sandwich while you’re eating.</li>
     </ol>
